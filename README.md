This fork is a modification of [leobas/tf](https://github.com/guilhermeleobas/tf)

You probably want to head there, as this is still incomplete and is not meant
as a tool for the user to run the benchmarks.

The end goal here is to compile every .c file and extract statistics using
the -stats flag.

Currently, running run.sh is dumping a json with statistics related to the
passes specified in comp.sh and info/passes.txt
